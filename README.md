# ECG-activity-recognition

In this project realized for the Human and Data Analytics course we exploit Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Autoencoders to recognize activities from the ECG signals recorded by PolarH10 chest strap heart rate sensor. The goal is to map each segment of the ECG signal into the action it is generated from, by distinguishing between Resting and Walking. The data are recorded from a population of six subjects of different ages and sex.
